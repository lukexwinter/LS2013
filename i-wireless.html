					<h1>i-wireless</h1>
					<h2>Design, Web Development</h2>
					<p>While working with Cincinnati Bell, I was given the task to re-design the i-wireless website.  Working off of existing brand guidelines I was able to design and develop an easy-to-use experience for pre-paid customers.  I was later given the opportunity to re-design a self care application for the website using responsive techniques that allows users to pay their bill, view their current usage and more, from any device.</p>
