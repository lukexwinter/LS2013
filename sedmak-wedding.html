				<h1>Sedmak Wedding</h1>
				<h2>Art Direction, Design, Web Development</h2>
				<p>I first found my love and curiosity for design with the rising popularity of the then Macromedia Flash platform. As a musician, I saw so many of the bands that I loved having these unique interactive experiences with fans such as myself through the use of their websites, I wanted to learn how I could create simlar experieces for the bands I was in at the time.</p>
