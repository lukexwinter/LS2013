				<h1>A bit about myself...</h1>
				<p>I am a print, multimedia, and web designer with a strong passion for my work. Throughout my 8 year professional career I have operated as the co-owner of an online apparel outfit known as Traditiona.  As a freelance graphic artist I offer creative design solutions and knowledge of graphic design, branding, and art direction to a number of start-up businesses and organizations within the United States.</p>
				<p>I believe strongly in the importance of design aesthetic coupled with an ease of functionality. I am passionate about helping clients find the best solution to fit their business needs as well as the needs of their audience. My self-motivated work ethic keeps me striving to never stop learning, and exploring new design and development techniques that can help to put high-quality projects into motion.</p>
